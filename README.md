# BookingApplication
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a GUI application created by me and https://github.com/Ambalabada
This application manages booking seats and holds the data using a postgresql server.

# Running jar file

When you run the application you are greeted with the login page. 

Here you are asked to input data for database connection:

1.Your database URL with the correct port:

For example: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8000/bookingapp

Note: the app implies that you already have a blank database named bookingapp

2.Your database username:

For example: postgres (default username for postgresql)

3.Your database password:

For example: qwerty123

If your user credentials are valid you get to use the app!

The app has a set of buttons each representing a seat. 
The program has the following functional:

1. You can book the seat.

2. You can delete a reservation.

3. You can easily see wich seats are booked and wich are free.

Note: The table for data managment is created automaticly.
